#Need to make month, day, year into one numeric "date" variable.

raw_data %>%
  mutate(month = factor(month, levels = c("January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July", "August", "September", "October", "November", "December")),
         year = as.integer(year)) %>%

#this isn't working

```

#Plan:
- Geom_point plot of killings in y axis vs time in x axis
- Date w highest number of killings (or month), location(s) in which they occurred
- Density plot of killings over time
- Map of killings w date
- If counties/states have multiple, single these out
